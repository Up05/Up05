###
I do coding.

I try to make my programs as simple and as fast to use as possible.

I have never managed to build a make/cmake/ninja/visual studio project on Windows and only once on Linux, because of that, I try to use as few libraries as possible and for C/C++/Odin projects I have `compile.bat` or `compile.sh` script, while Java ones, idfk... It's some IntelliJ/maven bullsh*t... I don't like it, but can't do anything about it..
For Web stuff, I only use HTML, JS (sometimes p5js.org) & CSS (used to use SCSS).  

*I have only been coding for 4/5 years now, so many of my earlier projects may not work on your system due to pathing errors, plus I only used Windows until 2024-08~15.  
Also, due to this lack of age, my philosophy, project structures and more have changed a lot, I've dabbled in many ways to package my applications and, at certain points in time, I have been a library junkie, take the previous paragraph with a grain of salt.*

List of things I've published:
- [WallpaperTODO2](https://github.com/Up05/WallpaperTODO2): (Windows) prints your TODOs on top of your wallpaper, to edit the TODOs start the program and it'll open notepad.exe, once you'll close the notepad document, text will be put on your wallpaper.
- [Alarm(s)](https://github.com/Up05/Alarm): (Windows) a simple cli for adding alarms, that does not use the default windows Notification system (because it is trash). To add an alarm: `alarm -a 1h 30m "too late..."`. Because it is only cpp with winsockets the server has very small footprint. (Although the CLI is Java, for some ungodly reason...)
- [copypasta](https://github.com/Up05/copypasta): (Linux) I never really found good copy-paste list software for Linux. Windows has the weird `Win + .` thing, which kinda works, and so I made my own. You, basically, go to the category you want, e.g.: `[S]Symbols` and get table (like Excel) of items, you can then select, e.g.: `∫` by pressing `g` and `1` and it puts the symbol into your (by default) `xsel -b` clipboard.  
- `f`: (Windows) (WIP) A proper file manager for Windows, because explorer.exe is just sh*t... But I'm not sure, if I'll finish `f` before 2025-10-14...
- [tetris](https://github.com/Up05/tetris): (Linux) A simple, yet riceable, tetris clone I made for Linux.
- [extract](https://github.com/Up05/extract): (Linux) As the description states: "It is made to extract all the god damn files..."
- [kb-homepage](https://github.com/Up05/dead-simple-startpage): Fast to load & keyboard-centric website made to quickly select website to go to. 
- [ast-visualizer](https://github.com/Up05/ast-visualizer): A simple visualizer for Abstract Syntax Trees, it takes in basic Lisp-like text (A (A B)) and displays it as a vertical tree (think lsblk or TREE)
- [sfx-picker](https://github.com/Up05/Sfx-Picker): (Windows) (Old) Soundboard...
- [edit-clips](https://github.com/Up05/ClipEditorV5) (v ±5): (Windows) A video editor made to slice & splice short videos as fast as possible, because I have thousands of them. Uses FFMPEG. concats everything into one long video.
- [odin-date-parser](https://github.com/Up05/odin-RFC-3339-date-parser): I didn't know odin-lang had this when I made it, but the official version is, in my opinion, still more cumbersome than mine.
- [odin-toml-parser](https://github.com/Up05/toml_parser): Exactly that, although, it has it's own ideas, i.e.: you can specify a backup compile-time config to use, if the key is not in the current config.
- [img2ascii2](https://github.com/Up05/img_to_ascii2): (Windows) Odin-lang version of an old project I made with NodeJS. It takes in an image (I think, .png or .jpg), converts it to basic text in the terminal and prints it to stdout.
- asteroids [Java](https://github.com/Up05/aSteROidS-Original) & [C](https://github.com/Up05/aSteROidS): (Windows) my first bigger GLFW (LWJGL and GLFW) projects, I thought this was the Asteroids game, I later learned, that I was wrong...
